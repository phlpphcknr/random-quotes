# Random Quotes

In the frame of FreeCodeCamp I built this app. 
Check: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

It displays random quotes fetched form a public API (https://type.fit/api/quotes). Furthermore, it is possible to share these quotes on twitter.

Enjoy the wisdom!

Cheers, Philipp
